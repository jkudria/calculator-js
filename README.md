# JS Calculator

Based on [lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) from The Odin Project

## TODO

* [x] buttons scale down/up when clicked (i.e. pressed effect)
	* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-a-pressed-effect-on-button-click-in-css/
* [ ] when operator pressed, start new number
* [ ] if too many characters in text area, shrink them to fit
* [ ] truncate decimal answers to X digits of accuracy
* [ ] better to transmit buttons -> js var -> text area, or buttons -> text area -> js var?
